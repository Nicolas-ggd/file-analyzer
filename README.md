# Text-Based File Analyzer

### My goal is to build file analyzer which reads some file extention, (.txt, .csv ...etc) and give the information basic metrics:
- Word Count: Total number of words in the text.
- Character Count: Total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation).
- Line Count: Total number of lines in the text.
- Average Word Length: Average length of words in the text.
- Sentence Count: Number of sentences (based on punctuation like periods, question marks, exclamation points).
- Average Sentence Length: Average number of words per sentence.
